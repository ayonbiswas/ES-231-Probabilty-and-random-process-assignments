# ES-231-Probabilty-and-random-process-assignments

**Assignment 1**
Matlab implementation of PCA on IRIS dataset.
- Files enclosed : iris_pca.m, iris.xls
- Dataset used : iris
- For running the matlab file, put iris.xls in the same directory as the matlab file and run.

**Assignmnet 2**
To design a target detection system for Radar or Sonar in the presence of additive white Gaussian
Noise when the signal is a random vector of size N. Evaluate the performance of the system
- signal_detection_1.m is for Estimating performance with different number of samples with fixed amplitude
- signal_detection_2.m is for Estimating performance with different amplitude and with fixed number of samples
- Just execute it. Press enter after each plot is shown as it is paused.
